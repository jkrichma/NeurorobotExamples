# Action Selection
# Jeff Krichmar, March 21 2021
#    September 9 2022: Updated for Webots R2022a.  There may be a warning on startup.  But should still work fine.

This directory contains a Webots project to simulate action selection.  It is inspired by a neurorobot model of the Basal Ganglia.
The code is structured after the Subsumption Architecture. It has several states and transition rules between states based on sensory events.
Trial metrics are written out in a file under the controller directory.

For more details on the Basal Ganglia model, see:
