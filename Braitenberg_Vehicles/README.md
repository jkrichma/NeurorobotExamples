# Braitenberg's Vehicles
# Jeff Krichmar, March 19 2021
#    September 9 2022: Updated for Webots R2022a.  There may be a warning on startup.  But should still work fine.

This directory contains a Webots project to try out Braitenberg Vehicles 2 and 3.  To try out different vehicles, change the string identifier towards the top of the Python controller.  You can move the light source by clicking on it with a mouse and then using the mouse to move the light while holding down the shift key.
