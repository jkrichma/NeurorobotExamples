# Model Free Reinforcement Learning in a Double-T maze
# Jeff Krichmar, March 21 2021
#    September 9 2022: Updated for Webots R2022a.  There may be a warning on startup.  But should still work fine.

This directory contains a Webots project to demonstrate Q learning.  The robot traverses a double-T maze. Rewards are in two of the 4 terminals.
A file is written out in the controller directory containing the likelihood of turning left or right at each decision point.
